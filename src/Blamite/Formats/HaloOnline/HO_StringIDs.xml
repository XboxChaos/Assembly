	<!-- StringIDs are grouped into sets, and this defines the modifiers to add to values in a set to translate them to array indices. The set number is the 2nd byte (bits 16-23) of the stringID value. -->
	<!-- <set> attributes available for use:
	id - Defines the ID number of the set.
	min - Defines the index at which the set begins. Values with indices lower than this will be counted as part of the previous set. Defaults to 0.
	startIndex - The index of the set's first string in the global table. In other words, the modifier value to add to indices that fall within the set after subtracting the min value. -->
	<!-- Any sets which are not defined here are assumed to be continuations of the previous set. -->
