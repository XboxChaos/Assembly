	<!-- To add a new build, just add the version number, and then depending on the game, the following;
	
				For engines that use a single pointer to the map header and the magic value just beyond:
				headerPointer       - The location of a pointer for a buffer containing the map header and magic. The offset (subtracting the header size) to the magic should be added to Engines.xml
				
				For engines where the above does not apply and the map header and magic are not pointers:
				headerAddress       - The location of the map header.
				magicAddress        - The location of the magic value to convert map addresses to runtime addresses.
				sharedMagicAddress  - The location of the magic value to convert shared map addresses to runtime addresses. For Second Generation.-->
