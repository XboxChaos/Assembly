	<comment title="CAMERA POSITIONING">The first Index refers to looking straight down, while the final Index is looking straight up

POSITIONS:
i = Forward and Back
j = Left and Right
k = Up and Down

In order to keep consistency, you should add/subtract the same number on all of the Indexes for your edits.
EXAMPLE: To increase view distance, add 5 to every 'i' value in the camera track.

Generally you do not want to rotate the camera, but you can with the Orientation values.</comment>
